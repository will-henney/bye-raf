Journal of my progress towards replacing IRAF in Tere's workflows
* Sample project from Tere
+ This is currently in a shared Dropbox folder, which I have locally renamed ~tere-sample-iraf-mes-project~
+ I need to find what a minimum set of fits files are for the entire workflow
+ Then I can copy those to this repo
