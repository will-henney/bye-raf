# Bye-RAF

Project to migrate away from IRAF in the reduction of data from the Manchester Echelle Spectrograph (MES) on the 2.1 m telescope of the Observatorio Astronómico Nacional at San Pedro Mártir (OAN-SPM), Baja California, Mexico.

The plan is to find user-friendly equivalents in Python for all reduction tasks that have traditionally been carried out in IRAF.
